# SNHU-CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This class was probably the hardest one I have done so far. I have tried my hardest understanding the completities of all the algorithms we talked about this class and I find that implementing them are harder said than done. This class really challenged me mentally.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I took my time with each week. Even needing to take some extra time to get some assignemnts and projects in but I think that helped me in the long run understand how this part of programming can be so important and how we need to think about each data structure we put into our projects.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had the roadblock of myself not understanding everything. Going through each week slowly and taking my time really helped.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I feel better prepared for being able to implement different and the correct data structures into my projects. This helps me in most projects I will need to do in the future. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I take my time to think about what data structure is needed in different cases. No longer am I just putting in a list or vector because that's what I know. Some times we need something more elaborate or more simple for things that won't be touched as much.
